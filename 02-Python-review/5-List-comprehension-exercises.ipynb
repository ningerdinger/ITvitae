    "## About these exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This set of exercises was written to accomodate a class of very mixed ability. The difficulty level of the exercises, therefore, ranges from 'easy' to 'really quite tricky' via 'only easy once you know how'. Therefore, don't be disheartened if you run into a difficult exercise: instead, tackle it, Google it, ask colleagues for tips, study the solution, try to recreate the solution, and learn as much as possible along the way.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The solutions are in the notebook `Exercises-solutions-english.ipynb'*\n",

    "## Exercises with dicts\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about dicts, and simple functions, but it is also about learning to read the Python documentation, and search it for the function you need.\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#mapping-types-dict\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function that takes a dict as input, and returns `True` if the dict contains the key `Jill`\n",
    "* Write a function that takes a dict as input, and returns a smaller dict with only those key-value pairs whose key starts with a capital\n",

    "## Exercises with `pathlib.Path`\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises let you practice interacting with files and folders. They also let you practice reading the Python standard library documention. Useful for this very common situtation: \"I should be able to do this with library functions. Let me read the docs, find the functions I need, and figure out how to use them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pathlib.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that returns True if the current folder contains a file called 'monkey'.\n",
    "* A function that returns a list of all files and folders in the current folder.\n",
    "* A function that returns two lists: one with all folders in the current folder, one with all files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced: generators and parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises take quite a bit of time: they consist of first reading an extract from a presentation that explains how to work with generators, and then making a few exercises. You will also need to figure out (or look up in the slides or solutions) how to extract data from a string, either via a regular expression, or by splitting the string into pieces and analysing those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the file `generators.pdf` in the `data` subfolder. (It is an extract of David Beazley's talk on generators. You can find the entire talk online at http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/.)\n",
    "2. Use the file `access-log` in de `data` subfolder: dit is a log of the webserver of David Beazley's website. \n",
    "3. Read `About access-log` below to learn how to interpret the access log.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advanced: Write the following script in generator pipeline style: a script that processes each line of the access log, extracts the number of bytes sent, sums those numbers and prints how many bytes were sent in total. (You've already seen this script in David Beazley's slides, *data/generators.pdf*. If you get stuck look at the example and try to understand it, then put it away and try to recreate it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advanced: Write a function that takes one argument: a string that represents part of a filename. The function should read the access log line by line, and count how often a filename is requested that contains the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advanced: Convert the function above to a generator function like you saw in the slides: instead of returning a number, it should yield the lines that contains the filename pattern, one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About access-log\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `access-log` contains about 7000 lines from a webserver's log. The lines look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    140.180.132.213 - - [24/Feb/2008:00:08:59 -0600] \"GET /ply/ply.html HTTP/1.1\" 200 97238\n",
    "\n",
    "Every line in that log represents an HTTP request: a person browsing the Internet tries to visit a page on David Bezley's website. Their browser sends a request to the webserver; the webserver serves the page, and logs the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the meaning of the parts of the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "| part                         | meaning                       |\n",
    "| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n",
    "| 140.180.132.213              | the requester's IP address    |\n",
    "| [24/Feb/2008:00:08:59 -0600] | the datetime and timezone     |\n",
    "| \"GET /ply/ply.html HTTP/1.1\" | the HTTP-request (see below)  |\n",
    "| 200                          | the HTTP response status code (200 is OK) [1] |\n",
    "| 97238                        | the number of bytes sent by the server |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the HTTP request is built up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET` : the HTTP-verb (POST submits a form, GET requests a page)\n",
    "* /ply/py.html  : the requested file/webpage.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Advanced: guessing game\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that lets the user guess a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It thinks of a number between 0 and 100.\n",
    "* It uses input() to ask the user for a guess.\n",
    "* If the guess is 'q', the function exits.\n",
    "* It prints 'lower' or 'higher' if the true number is lower/higher than the guess.\n",
    "* If the user guesses right, the function exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `while`, specifically `while True` to keep looping while the guess is wrong\n",
    "* `break` to break out of the loop when the guess is right\n",
    "* `continue` to skip the rest of the loop body, jump to the top, and start a new cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tricky to get right: number guesser\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that guesses a number\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user thinks of a number between 0 and 100\n",
    "* De function prints a guess, and uses `input()` to ask the user if the guess is correct.\n",
    "* The user indicates whether the number is higher or lower than the guess.\n",
    "* When the user indicates the guess is correct, the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not that hard once you know how: convert the guessing_game function to a command-line script\n",
    "\n",
    "If this exercise is more interesting to you than the guessing game exercise (which it builds on), feel free to copy paste the guessing game function from the solutions and proceed from there!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python command-line script is in a `.py`-file, and has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "    def main(command_line_arguments)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        main(sys.argv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a command-line script that can be invoked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python guessing_game.py 40\n",
    "\n",
    "after which the user may guess the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect when the program is invoked without a number argument; in that case, the script chooses a number on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "      python guessing_game.py\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make it possible for the user to pass their name, after which the programm addresses them by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "      python guessing_game.py 40 Draco"

    "# A. Introduction - What is Version Control ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to a set of data over time. The most important purposes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It **keeps track of all changes** made to a file\n",
    "2. As changes are tracked, a history of different versions is tracked and **different versions can be recalled**\n",
    "3. It can **merge different versions** of a file, which allows team members to edit the same file\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can think about “replaying” different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without version control software developers would have to maintain multiple copies of different versions of the program, label them appropriately and wait for permission of developers managing the project. With the use of version control software these steps are more automated and take place behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even when you're not collaborating, version control can prove useful in avoiding situations like the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/versies.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, most version control systems are based around one main concept; tracking changes within directories or files. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Distributed vs Centralised Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributed version control takes a peer-to-peer approach, each developer works directly with his or her own local repository, and changes are shared between repositories as a separate step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional centralised version control takes a client-server model where developers use a shared single central repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git, Mercurial, SVN**\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the most popular version control systems are **Git**, **Mercurial** and **SVN**. Of these, Git and Mercurial are distributed and SVN is centralized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Git and Mercurial can be used through a graphical frontend or through the command line.  For this lab session we will use the command line to perform version control actions with **Git**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though Git and Mercurial are distributed systems by design, they are very often used in a setup where all users connect to a central repository."

    "## Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already done so, download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, open a terminal window (in Windows: Git Bash) and follow along. The command-line-tool to communicate with Git is `git`. Depending on the action you want to perform Git commands are written as `git <action>`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using git for the first time, you have to configure some personal settings to git that only need to be run once, using `git config`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **git config**: View and/or change configuration settings\n",
    "\n",

    "$ git config --global user.email \"name@company.com\"\n",

    "## Repository \n",
    "A repository holds the set of files and directories that are under version control. The repository will track all changes that are made to the files or directories. Note that it's not going to store every old version, only the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in teams means we have to distinguish different types of repositories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to collaborate with a VCS is to set up a **central repository** (also called remote repository). This central repository is stored on a server.  **Local repositories** refer to the repositories each team member or person has on his or her local computer. When collaborating, team members can push the changes they have been making in their local repository to the remote repository, or they can pull the latest version from the remote repository into their local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/Repositories.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main scenario's to start working in a repository: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 1 - Initializing new repository**: You specify a directory that should have changes tracked by version control. So, you have to tell the VCS which of your files you wish to have under version control. So you have to **initialize** a repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **git init**: Creates a new local repository with the specified name\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2 - Cloning existing repository**: You are new to a company and want to start working on an existing project together with team mates. As there is already an existing central repository running on a server, you have to **clone** this repository onto your own computer as a local repository in order to work on it.\n",
    " \n",
    "> **git clone**: Downloads a project and its entire version history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** For this lab session you want to set up a project called 'Recipes' that is under version control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a directory for the Recipes project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ mkdir Recipes\n",

    "\n",
    "In the Recipies directory a hidden directory is created: .git. This directory includes all methods and processes needed for version control.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a file called VegetableSoup.txt that contains the ingredients for a soup we want to store and track changes of. You can choose to make the file in your favourite text editor or through the terminal. \n",

    "While you are working on the files in your local repository, each change is tracked automatically. Changes include adding, modifying, moving or deleting a file. Instead of recording each change individually in a file, Git will let you decide which changes make up the next version, by making a **commit**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **git commit**: Commit changes to the files that were specified (for example to add files to the repository) \n",
    "\n",
    "So before you are able to commit, you need to specify the actions made on current changes you want to track. Possible actions to specify include: \n",
    "\n",
    "> **git add**: Schedule files to be version controlled and that are added to the repository on the next commit. If no names are given add all files to the repository that have been changed (CVS will track this automatically)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **git remove** or **git rm**: Remove the specified files on the next commit\n",

    "*Note: using single quotes has been observed to cause issues on Windows so use double quotes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-m flag` is used to set a commit-message that should note what the commit is about. After a commit, git will store a copy of that current situation in time inside the .git directory. It is like making a snapshot of that moment. Each commit also has its unique identifier.\n",

    "# F. Dealing with conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "When working together, team members often make different changes to the same files locally, which can result in **conflicts**. With version control we are able to manage these conflicts. To see how we can solve conflicts we will now deliberately create a conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along with the actions, work together with the same partner as in the previous section. Make sure the VegetableSoup.txt file looks the same for both partners in their local repositories. The state of the repositories probably looks something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/repos4.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of the partners, make some modifications locally by adding another ingredient and make sure the modification gets pushed to the central repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the repositories look something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/repos5.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the other partner should make some changes to their recipe file as well. (Normally it is **good practice to update the local repository before making changes**, but here we deliberately don't pull).\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the repositories now look similar to: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/repos6.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: What happens when you commit and try to push the changes to the central repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git detects that the changes in the copy made overlap with those made in the other. Moreover, working separately on the same project, the histories of each repository are **starting to diverge**. A conflict emerges when a team member made changes that intersect with your changes. As the VCS can not determine which change is correct, it will give you an option to see the difference between the conflicting versions, so you can correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **resolve the conflict**, we first need to pull the changes on the central repository on Gitlab, then merge them into the copy the partner was working on (the local one which was not able to push) and then push the merge back to the central repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "$ git pull origin master ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will tell you there is a conflict, the conflict will be marked in the effected file. So lets look at the file by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cat VegetableSoup.txt ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrolling through the file you will see that git marks the conflict area with the signs: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "<The line of change by one Partner> \n",
    "=======\n",
    "<The line of change by the other Partner>\n",
    ">>>>>>> dapp4c8c230e8475aee9b14b4793acc99f42af1d ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that after `Head` your changes will be stated, Git then puts a separator between the conflicting changes with the ======= line, the end of the conflict area is marked with the >>>>>>> line and a hexadecimal string which refers to the last downloaded commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the pull the repositories state looks similar to the image below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/repos7.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the conflict needs to be solved by hand, by removing the markers and reconsile the changes. It is up to you what you want: \n",
    "\n",
    "- keep your own change \n",
    "- keep the change made and pushed to the central repository (so the change by the other partner) \n",
    "- write a complete new line \n",
    "- or remove both changes (the conflict area) entirely \n",
    "\n",
    "For now lets replace the whole conflict area with a new ingredient by removing the lines that indicate the conflict area and add the ingredient: 'two spoons of cream'. Again this can be done by a text editor or through the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the merge (set by hand, to solve the conflict) we need to commit the 'merge'/change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add VegetableSoup.txt\n",
    "$ git commit -m 'Merge changes, conflict solved'```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have to push the changes to the central repository on Github/Gitlab:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git push origin master ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the repository now looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/repos8.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Git keeps track of what we’ve merged with what. So when the partner who made the first change pulls the changes from the central repository, it gets the merged VegetableSoup.txt file. This partner does not need to merge again as Git tracked that the other Partner already did this. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the lab session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: Keep in mind that when working in collaboration it's important to update your local repository frequently with the central repository. Furthermore, making small commits ensures the changes are easier to oversee!"
